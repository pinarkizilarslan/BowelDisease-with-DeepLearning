# Bowel Diseases with Deep Learning
A deep learning model has been developed to diagnose and classify large bowel diseases.

The model was trained, validated and tested in the cloud-based, easy-to-use and collaborative Google Colaboratory programming environment. In addition, Keras structure, which is one of the open source libraries developed for deep learning applications, is used. The deep learning model is trained with a dataset created by combining more than one public dataset. This data set consists of 2507 colonoscopic images that contain 4 different types of large bowel disease and normal bowel images.

A classification model with five labels: cancer, ulcerative colitis, crohns, polyp diseases, and normal bowel was presented to the Doctor role in the project to evaluate colonoscopic images. In addition, a two-class detection model has been developed to detect diseased or healthy intestines. Both models are trained using Efficientnet version 1 and version 2 convolutional neural networks.

Among the developed deep learning models, the classification model can classify the incoming colonoscopy image for 5 classes, including normal, cancer, ulcerative colitis, polyp, and Crohns disease, with a 93% accuracy, while the diagnostic model can diagnose normal and diseased bowel with a 97% accuracy.

After the deep learning model was trained with the Python programming language, it was run on a server and used in the web application. In the scenario, the doctor user logging into the system can bring the patient information and learn the disease after uploading the image.
